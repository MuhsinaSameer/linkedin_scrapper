Project Building Steps

1) We need to create a login to linkdin with selenium using chromedriver 
2) Using Voyager api we need to fetch the data from linkdin 
3) A REST Api is created and the response from voyager api is sent to REST api and the json data is built which include the details of the connections. 
4) A token authentication is done for REST api.
